# Bicep error code - BCP009

This error occurs when a declaration is not completed.

## Error description

`Expected a literal value, an array, an object, a parenthesized expression, or a function call at this location.`

## Solution

Include the missing part.  For more information, see [Bicep file](../file.md).

## Examples

The following example raises the error because the `metadata` declaration isn't completed:

```bicep
metadata description = 
```

You can fix the error by using completing the declaration.

```bicep
metadata description = 'Creates a storage account and a web app'
```
