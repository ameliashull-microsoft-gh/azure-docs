# Bicep error code - BCP124

This error occurs when you specify a decorator that isn't supported by the type of the syntax being decorated.

## Error description

`The decorator <decorator-name> can only be attached to targets of type <data-type>, but the target has type <data-type>.`

## Solutions

Use the valid decorators based on the data types.

## Examples

The following example raises the error because `@maxValue()` is for the integer data type, not for the string data type.

```bicep
@maxValue(3)
param name string 
```

You can fix the error by providing the correct decorator for the data type:

```bicep
@maxLength(3)
param name string 
```

For a list of decorators, see [Decorators](../file.md#decorators).
